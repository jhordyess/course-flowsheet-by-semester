# Course Flowsheet by Semester

This project represents one of my first steps in programming, approximately in  2017 🤓.

Create a dynamic course flowsheet by semester and identify all prerequisites or post requisite.

It's possible to create a dynamic course flowsheet by semester, defining the semester, courses names, and courses prerequisites(post requisites will be found automatically).

Using mouseover dynamically, the prerequisites and post requisites change of style.

To test your own course flowsheet, just modify the [semesters.json](/src/data/example/semesters.json) file.

This is the result using some example: <https://jhordyess.github.io/course-flowsheet-by-semester/>
