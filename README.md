# Course Flowsheet by Semester

This project represents one of my first steps in programming, approximately inÂ  2017 ðŸ¤“.

Create a dynamic course flowsheet by semester and identify all prerequisites or post requisite.

It's possible to create a dynamicÂ course flowsheet by semester, defining the semester, courses names, and courses prerequisites(post requisites will be found automatically).

Using mouseoverÂ dynamically, the prerequisites and post requisites change of style.

To test your own course flowsheet, just modifyÂ the [semesters.json](/src/data/example/semesters.json) file.

This is the result using some example: <https://jhordyess.github.io/course-flowsheet-by-semester/>

## Evolution from JQuery

The original idea was started with JQuery when I starting in programming ðŸ˜Œ, see the code and example: <https://github.com/jhordyess/course-flowsheet-by-semester-jquery>

Now uses React with TypeScript, bundle with Webpack.
