# Course Flowsheet by Semester

This project represents one of my first steps in programming, approximately in  2017 🤓.

It's a React component for a dynamic course flowsheet by semester, identifying all prerequisites or postrequisites.

## Description

Using mouseover dynamically, the prerequisites and post requisites change their style.

To test your own course flowsheet, just modify the [semesters.json](/src/data/example/semesters.json) file.

This is the result using my example: <https://jhordyess.github.io/course-flowsheet-by-semester/>
