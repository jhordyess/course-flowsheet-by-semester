# Course Flowsheet by Semester

This project represents one of my first steps in programming, approximately in  2017.

It's possible to create a dynamic course flowsheet by semester, defining the semester, courses names, and courses prerequisites(post requisites will be found automatically).

All semesters and courses are grouped by HTML table and created with Jquery.

Using mouseover dynamically, the prerequisites and post requisites change of style, also with Jquery.

To test your own course flowsheet, just modify the semesters.js file.
